## 🛠 How to Use This Repository
1. **Replicate the Study**:  
   - Run the [timer script](/src/search_timer.py) to measure AI response times.  
   - Review the [raw data](/data/responses.xlsx) for citations and response details.  
2. **Extend the Research**:  
   - Add new queries to test additional categories (e.g., non-English prompts).  
   - Improve the timer with automated APIs (e.g., Selenium).

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Manual timing may introduce human error.  
- Free-tier models may have rate limits or reduced features.  
- Small sample size (12 queries total).
