# Evaluating_AI_Web_Search

After several years of using various AI Assistants and pushing each one to its limits, something continues to intrigue me:
How do AI Assistants search the web? What does it take to search the Internet, compare sources, analyze them, and prepare information for users? Why do models use different sources of information for the same search query?

These questions, along with several others, are what I attempt to answer in this small study. I've identified patterns and statistics that are important to consider when choosing an AI Assistant for searching the web to gather information.
